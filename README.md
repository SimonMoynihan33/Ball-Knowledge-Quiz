## Why 

Why did I choose this topic? Soccer as a sport is very close to me. It has truly helped me through tougher times in life as an escape, and I believe many people can resonate with that. I watch, and play, as much as I can today and it's often to high point of my day. It's the beautiful game.

Due to having no backend and having to use local storage, which is limited in its abilities, I did not implement the leaderboard feature.
