## Why 

Why did I choose this topic? Soccer as a sport is very close to me. It has truly helped me through tougher times in life as an escape, and I believe many people can resonate with that. I watch, and play, as much as I can today and it's often to high point of my day. It's the beautiful game.

Due to having no backend and having to use local storage, which is limited in its abilities, I did not implement the leaderboard feature.

## User Experience

Users who come to this web app will be greeted with a sleek homepage, with a nice color pallette, featuring a light blue color on buttons and some text and a dark black background image. This hopes to promote a positive and memorable user experience.

### First Time Users

First time users want to:
- Understand what the site is

### Repeat Users

Users who wish to use the site more than once can do so, hoping to improve on their score with each subsequent attempt. A good foundation has been built and can be used as a springboard to make this app much larger scale. In the future more quiz options will be added, with varying difficulties and more niche quizzes, such as specific tournaments and teams.

## Goals

The goal of this weba app is to test the users knowledge of the sport, and also educate while allowing users to enjoy the experience and feel rewarded afterwards either for good knowledge of the sport, or learning and increasing their expertise.
